    <h1>My College Journey</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My college journey began in 2021 when I enrolled in Georgia Southern University. It was an exciting time filled with anticipation and new experiences. I even felt a bit nervous coming in due to it being a real change of
            pace compared to high school, but it was something that I knew I will be able to get through. Im glad I continued to pursue further education. Over the period of my first semster of college things started to click, and 
            I started to get into the groove of things. I am thankful for my college years. Without it I wouldn't have been able to meet all the people that I did while I was there.

        <h2>Extracurricular</h2>
        <p>
        While in college I was apart of three organizations. The first being Geeks 'N' Gamers I joined this club my freshman year during my first smester. A year and half later I became the Treasurer for the Organization. 
        The next organization that I joined was the Insitute of Electrical Electronics Engineers (IEEE). I joined IEEE in my sophmore year of college, and the main 
        thing that we had did that year was a sumo robot competition. This was really fun and my first introduction to C++, and various different sensors such as infared, and ultrasonics. It was really cool and such a different experience for me.
        I then became the robotics lead for the organization, and lead team to compete in the IEEE SoutheastCon. This was a really challenging experience and was filled with situations that we had to overcome.
        In my spring semster of junior year I also joined the Association for Computing Machinery where I continued developing my programming skills.
